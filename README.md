# Anagram Generator

This script will generate anagrams from input words, but only if they are absolute matches. As the input is not a valid anagram of itself, this will of course be excluded.

Partial matching may be added down the road.

## Installation

No external modules required. Just have the `Dictionary.txt` and `application.py` in the same directory when you run the script. 

## Usage

1. Run the script with `python application.py` in the folder containing the script.
2. Type in the word(s) you'd like to generate anagrams for and hit Enter.

## Contributing

Contributions always welcome.
